# ✅ Compilation Errors Fixed

## Summary
Fixed all compilation errors in the Necromancer skill editor scripts.

## Error 1: SkillConfig.duration doesn't exist (CreateRaiseDead.cs)
- Removed `skill.duration = 20f;` (line 37)
- Changed log to use `summonEffect.duration` (line 87)

## Error 2: SkillConfig.duration doesn't exist (SkillExecutor.cs)
- Added duration extraction from SummonMinion effect (lines 871-883)

## Error 3: SkillCustomData is not a ScriptableObject (CreateBloodForMana.cs)
- Changed to `new SkillCustomData()` instead of `ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<>()`
- Removed `AssetDatabase.AddObjectToAsset()` call

## Status: ✅ ALL FIXED - Ready for testing!
